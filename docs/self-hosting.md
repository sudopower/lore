# Self-hosting lore on a VPS

lore runs on one small arm64 VPS (a Hetzner CAX21 class server is enough) with docker compose. The stack has four services:

- `lore`, the server;
- `db`, Postgres 17 with pgvector;
- `caddy`, which gets a TLS certificate by itself and refuses `/v1/admin/*` from the internet;
- `backup`, a `pg_dump` once a day, kept for seven days.

The files are in `deploy/`: `compose.prod.yml`, `Caddyfile`, `env.prod.example`. `compose.local.yml` is only for the rehearsal below.

## Rehearse it on your machine

```sh
make prod-local            # builds the image, starts the stack, checks it
make prod-local-backup     # takes a dump and checks that it holds the schema
make prod-local-down       # stops the stack and deletes its volumes
```

`make prod-local` needs docker compose 2.24 or newer and free ports 8081 and 8443. It creates `deploy/.env.prod` with random local values (it is ignored by git), uses `LORE_LLM=fake` and the hash embedder, so it needs no API key and downloads no model. It prints the `/healthz` body, then checks that `POST /mcp` without a key answers 401 (MCP is reachable through Caddy) and that `/v1/admin/tenants` answers 403 (Caddy blocks the admin API). Caddy serves `localhost` with its own CA, so use `curl -k`.

## Deploy

1. Create an arm64 VPS with Debian 13, Docker Engine and the compose plugin (2.24 or newer). The firewall allows only ports 22, 80 and 443.
2. Point a DNS A record for your domain at the server's IP.
3. On the server, copy `deploy/env.prod.example` to `/opt/lore/.env.prod` and fill it in: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN` (`openssl rand -hex 24`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Keep the file private (`chmod 600`).
4. From a checkout of this repo, run:

   ```sh
   make deploy-prod HOST=root@<ip> LORE_DOMAIN=<domain> VERSION=<tag>
   ```

   It builds the image for arm64, sends it over ssh, copies `compose.prod.yml` and `Caddyfile` to `/opt/lore`, starts the stack and prints `/healthz`. The first start downloads the embedding model (about 130 MB) into the `loredata` volume, which is why the `lore` health check has a 180 second start period.

## Admin commands

Caddy blocks `/v1/admin`, so admin commands run on the server. The container already has `LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN` in its environment:

```sh
ssh <host> 'cd /opt/lore && docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod.yml exec lore lore --url http://localhost:8080 admin tenant create --name glassflow'
```

Everything else (`repo push`, `search`, `ask`, MCP) goes through `https://<domain>` with a tenant key.

## Backups and restore

The `backup` service writes `/opt/lore/backups/lore-<date>-<time>.sql.gz` every 24 hours and deletes dumps older than 7 days. Copy them off the server if you want more than one machine's worth of safety.

To restore, on the server. The dump only creates objects, so loading it over a database that already has the tables fails on duplicate keys and loads nothing. Empty the schema first, with lore stopped:

```sh
cd /opt/lore
C="docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f compose.prod.yml"
$C stop lore backup
$C exec -T db psql -U lore -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 lore -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;'
gunzip -c backups/<file> | $C exec -T db psql -U lore -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 lore
$C up -d --wait
```

The dump creates the `vector` extension again, so nothing else is needed. `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` makes psql stop at the first error instead of exiting 0 over a half-loaded database.

The `loredata` volume (repo mirrors and the model cache) is not in the dump. After a restore onto a fresh volume, run `lore repo push --full` for each repo. lore also answers `need_full_bundle`, and the CLI then retries with a full bundle on its own.

## Upgrade and roll back

Upgrade by running `make deploy-prod` again with a new `VERSION`. Roll back by running it with the previous `VERSION`. Migrations only move forward, so undoing one means restoring a backup taken before the upgrade.
