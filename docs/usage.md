# Using lore

Tenants and keys, indexing, search, traces, documents, answers, the web page and MCP. Every endpoint is also reachable from the `lore` CLI.

## Tenants and keys

lore is multi-tenant. Each tenant has API keys with the scopes `ingest` and `read`. Keys look like `lk_` followed by 40 hex characters, and only their SHA-256 hash is stored, so a key is shown once, when it is created. An admin token (`LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN` on the server) creates tenants and keys. Without it the admin API answers 403.

The CLI talks to the server over HTTP. `--url`, `--key` and `--admin-token` are global flags (env `LORE_URL`, `LORE_KEY`, `LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN`), and the `admin` and `me` subcommands print the server's JSON.

```bash
export LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN=dev-admin               # with `make run` going in another shell
lore admin tenant create --name demo            # {"id": "...", "name": "demo"}
lore admin tenant list
lore admin key create --tenant <id>             # {"id": "...", "key": "lk_...", ...}; add --scopes read to limit it
lore admin key list --tenant <id>               # prefixes only, never the key or its hash
lore admin key revoke <key-id>                  # the key stops working at once
lore --key lk_... me                            # {"tenant_id": "...", "tenant_name": "demo", "scopes": [...]}
```

Tenant names are 1 to 64 characters of `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`. Send keys as `Authorization: Bearer lk_...`.

## Repos

A repo source is pushed as a git bundle. The server keeps a bare mirror and a checkout under `$LORE_DATA_DIR/repos/<source id>/`, and needs `git` on its path (the Docker image installs it). Both routes need an `ingest` key; listing needs `read`.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/repos -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name": "sample"}'      # {"id": "...", "name": "sample", ...}
curl localhost:8080/v1/repos -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY"
git bundle create /tmp/repo.bundle HEAD
curl -X PUT "localhost:8080/v1/repos/<id>/bundle?ref=$(git rev-parse HEAD)&full=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY" --data-binary @/tmp/repo.bundle
```

`ref` is the full 40 character lowercase sha of the bundle's `HEAD`. With `full=true` the bundle holds the whole history and the tree is re-indexed, deleting documents of files that are gone. With `full=false` the bundle may be incremental (`git bundle create out.bundle <last-sha>..HEAD`) and only changed files are indexed. If the server no longer has the last indexed commit, or the bundle needs commits it lacks, the answer is 409 (`need_full_bundle`) and the client sends a full bundle. The answer is a report with `indexed_commit`, `files_indexed`, `files_unchanged`, `files_skipped`, `files_deleted` and `chunks`.

Symlinks, submodules, binary or non-UTF-8 files, files over 256 KiB, and lock files, build output and vendored directories are skipped and counted in `files_skipped`.

## Index a repo

`lore repo push` indexes the committed HEAD of a local git repo. It needs `git` on the path and an `ingest` key.

```bash
export LORE_URL=http://localhost:8080 LORE_KEY=lk_...
lore repo push . --name sample          # indexed sample at 1a2b3c4: 6 indexed, 0 unchanged, 0 deleted, 1 skipped, 31 chunks
lore repo push ~/code/app --json        # the report as one line of JSON
lore repo list                          # name, short indexed commit and web URL template, one repo per line
```

`PATH` defaults to `.` and can be any directory inside the repo. `--name` defaults to the name of the repo's top level directory.
The first push sends the whole history. Later pushes send only the commits the server lacks, and when the server already has HEAD nothing is sent and the report is all zeros.
If the server lost its copy, or the history was rewritten (for example after a force push), the CLI falls back to a full bundle by itself. `--full` forces one.
Uncommitted changes are not indexed, and the CLI says so on stderr.
`--web-url <template>` stores a URL template for links to files, for example `https://github.com/acme/app/blob/{commit}/{path}`. `repo list --json` prints the server's JSON on one line.

To index on every push to main, run it from CI. A GitHub Actions step (the checkout needs the full history on every push, so keep `fetch-depth: 0`: a shallow clone that lacks the commits the server has makes the push fail):

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  lore:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Index the repo in lore
        run: lore --url $LORE_URL --key ${{ secrets.LORE_KEY }} repo push . --name <repo>
        env:
          LORE_URL: ${{ vars.LORE_URL }}
```

The `lore` binary has to be on the runner (build it with `cargo install --path .` or copy a release binary).

## Search

`GET /v1/search` searches the chunks of the key's tenant. It needs a `read` key, and another tenant's documents are never visible: a source name from another tenant just matches nothing.

```bash
curl -G localhost:8080/v1/search -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'q=plan limits' --data-urlencode 'k=5' --data-urlencode 'kind=code,doc'
lore search "plan limits"                       # the same, from the CLI
lore search "pricing plans" --kind doc --k 3
lore search "plan limits" --source sample --json
```

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `q` | The query. Required: a missing or blank `q` is a 400. At most 2000 characters, otherwise a 400. It cannot contain a NUL byte |
| `k` | How many hits, default 10. Any integer is accepted and clamped to 1 to 50. Something that is not an integer is a 400 |
| `kind` | Comma-separated document kinds: `code`, `doc`, `session`, `note`. Another name is a 400 that lists the kinds. Empty means all |
| `source` | Only the source with this name, whatever its kind (`repo`, `traces`, `documents`). Empty means all. A name that matches nothing gives no hits |

The answer is `{"hits": [...]}`, best first. A hit has `chunk_id`, `document_id`, `source`, `kind`, `title`, `uri`, `path`, `start_line`, `end_line` (1-based, inclusive), `symbols`, `snippet` (the first 40 lines of the chunk) and `score`. `path` is set for repo files only. `uri` is the source's `web_url_template` filled in for repo files (see below), or else the document's own URI, or null.

The `web_url_template` of a repo source can use `{path}`, `{commit}`, `{start}` and `{end}`, for example `https://github.com/acme/app/blob/{commit}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}`. `{path}` is percent-encoded segment by segment (the `/` between segments stays), so a space, `#`, `?` or `%` in a file name cannot change the link. Other `{...}` text is left as it is.

How it ranks: the query is run twice, once against the Postgres full-text index (any query word may match, ranked with `ts_rank_cd`) and once against the pgvector embeddings (cosine distance). Each run keeps its best 50 chunks. The two lists are merged with Reciprocal Rank Fusion: a chunk scores the sum of `1 / (60 + rank)` over the lists it is in, so the score is at most about 0.033 and is only good for comparing hits of one search. Ties go to the better full-text rank, then to the lower chunk id. A query with only stop words (`the and of`) has no full-text part and is answered from the vectors alone. Identifiers such as `MaxSeatsPerPlan` are also indexed as the words `max seats per plan`, so a search for "seats" finds them.

The CLI prints, for each hit, `path:start-end  (score 0.032)  symbols` (the title when there is no path), then the first 3 snippet lines indented by 4 spaces. `--json` prints the server's JSON on one line. No hits prints `no results` on stderr and exits 0.

## Traces

`POST /v1/traces` takes OpenTelemetry traces over OTLP/HTTP, so an agent or a collector can export its sessions to lore. It needs an `ingest` key. Send `Content-Type: application/json` or `application/x-protobuf`, optionally with `Content-Encoding: gzip`. Anything else is a 415. A bad body is a 400. A body over 16 MiB, one that unzips to more than 64 MiB, or one whose spans would store more than 64 MiB of row data (the resource attributes count once per span) is a 413. A span whose trace id is not 16 bytes, whose span id is not 8 bytes, or whose parent span id is not empty or 8 bytes is not stored; the answer is still a 200 and carries `partialSuccess` with `rejectedSpans` and an `errorMessage`. A session id over 512 bytes is shortened to its first part plus a hash, so two long ids stay distinct. With nothing rejected the answer is an empty `ExportTraceServiceResponse` in the format of the request.

Spans are stored per tenant, keyed by trace id and span id, so sending a span again updates it. A span's session is its `session.id` attribute, else `gen_ai.conversation.id`, else the resource's `session.id`, else its trace id. Each session is queued for indexing. Strings longer than 64 KiB are cut and end with `…[truncated]`.

```bash
lore otlp send tests/fixtures/otlp/claude_code_session.json          # JSON, needs --url and --key
lore otlp send tests/fixtures/otlp/otel_genai_session.json --protobuf --gzip
```

`lore otlp send <FILE.json>` posts an OTLP JSON file to `/v1/traces` with the global `--url` and `--key`. `--protobuf` converts it to protobuf first, and `--gzip` compresses the body. It prints `HTTP <status>` and exits non-zero when the server does not answer 2xx.

## Documents

`POST /v1/documents` stores notes and documents that are not in a repo or a trace, and indexes them so search and ask find them. It needs an `ingest` key.

```bash
curl -X POST "$LORE_URL/v1/documents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "notes", "documents": [
        {"external_id": "n1", "title": "Review", "text": "The quarterly zorblax review moved to Thursdays."}
      ]}'
# {"upserted":1,"unchanged":0,"chunks":1}
```

`source` names a group of documents (1 to 100 characters of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -`, but not `.` or `..`; it is created on first use). `documents` has 1 to 100 entries. Each has an `external_id` (1 to 512 bytes, unique within the source, with no `.` or `..` between slashes, so `a.b` and `a/.b` are fine but `..` and `a/../b` are not), a `title` of at most 1 KiB, a `text` of at most 1 MiB, and optionally `kind` (`note`, the default, or `doc`), `uri` (shown with search hits, at most 2,048 bytes) and `metadata` (a JSON object of at most 64 KiB once serialized). A text that makes more than 1000 chunks is refused too. Anything invalid is a 400 and nothing of that request is written. The body may be up to 128 MiB; more is a 413.

Putting an `external_id` again replaces the document. When its kind, title, text, uri and metadata are all the same as stored, it is skipped and counted in `unchanged`, so repeating a sync is cheap. If one id appears twice in a request, the documents are handled in order and the last one wins. The text is split into sections at markdown headings, and long sections into overlapping windows of lines. All of the text is searchable: a window is kept within 8,000 characters, and a single line longer than that is split into several chunks (at a space when there is one close to the end) instead of being cut.

```bash
lore doc put --source notes --id n1 --title "Review" --text "The quarterly zorblax review moved to Thursdays."
lore doc put --source wiki --id guide --title "Guide" --file guide.md --kind doc --uri https://example.com/guide
lore doc get <DOCUMENT_ID>                      # prints the text
lore doc rm --source notes --id n1
```

`GET /v1/documents/{id}` (a `read` key) returns `{"id", "kind", "title", "uri", "metadata", "text"}` for any document of the tenant, using the `document_id` of a search hit. For a document put through the API the text is exactly what was sent (line endings, blank lines and the final newline included), cut at 100,000 characters; for repo files and sessions it is rebuilt from the indexed chunks. `DELETE /v1/documents/{source}/{external_id}` (an `ingest` key) answers 204, or 404 when the tenant has no such document; an `external_id` may contain `/`, and other special characters must be percent-encoded. `lore doc put` accepts either `--file` or `--text`, and prints the server's JSON.

## Ask

`POST /v1/ask` answers a question from the key's tenant, with numbered citations. It needs a `read` key. Fast mode runs one hybrid search (the same as `/v1/search`), puts the best passages in a prompt as numbered sources, and makes one model call.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/ask -H "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question": "how many plans are there and what are their limits?"}'
lore ask "how many plans are there and what are their limits?"     # the same, from the CLI
lore ask "who owns billing?" --kind doc,note --k 8 --source sample
lore ask "how many plans are there?" --json                        # the server's JSON on one line
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `question` | Required. A missing or blank question is a 400. At most 2000 characters, otherwise a 400 |
| `mode` | `fast` (the default) or `deep`. `deep` runs an agent loop (see below) and is a 400 ("deep mode needs a tool-capable model provider (LORE_LLM=anthropic)") with `LORE_LLM=openai` |
| `k` | Fast mode only: how many sources to retrieve, default 12, clamped to 1 to 50 |
| `kind` | Fast mode only: a list of document kinds: `code`, `doc`, `session`, `note`. Another name is a 400 |
| `source` | Fast mode only: only the source with this name |

The answer is `{"answer", "mode", "model", "citations", "sources_considered", "tool_calls", "usage", "latency_ms"}`. `citations` lists the sources the answer cites with `[n]`, once each, in the order they first appear. A citation has `label` (the source number, as text), `document_id`, `kind`, `title`, `path`, `start_line`, `end_line` and `url` (the same link `/v1/search` gives as `uri`). `sources_considered` is the number of passages that went into the prompt (at most 60,000 characters of them, each cut to its first 120 lines), `tool_calls` is 0 in fast mode, and `usage` has `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`.

When nothing indexed matches, the answer is "I found nothing indexed that matches this question.", `model` is `"none"` and the model is not called. If the model declines to answer, the response is a 422 `{"error": "the model declined to answer"}`.

Deep mode (`"mode": "deep"`) lets the model drive the `search`, `grep`, `read_file` and `get_session` tools for up to `LORE_DEEP_MAX_ROUNDS` rounds within `LORE_DEEP_BUDGET_SECS` seconds. Tool calls of one round run at the same time, each for at most 10 seconds; a slower one gives the model an error result. Past 80% of the budget, or at the round cap, the model gets one last call with the tools turned off and is told to answer. Cost is capped per tenant by `LORE_DEEP_CONCURRENCY` and `LORE_DEEP_DAILY_LIMIT` (both give a 429). A deep answer cites code as `[path:start-end]`, with the path as the tools print it minus the source name, and sessions as `[session:<id>]`. Each distinct citation appears once in `citations` (at most 50), in order of first appearance. The `label` is the text between the brackets. A citation whose path or session lives in the tenant's index carries `document_id`, `kind`, `title` and `url`; one that does not match keeps its `label`, `path` and lines, with `document_id` null. In deep mode `tool_calls` counts the tool calls, `sources_considered` is 0, `usage` is summed over all model calls and `model` is the model of the last call. If the budget runs out with no answer at all, the response is a 500.

The CLI prints the answer, a blank line, a `Sources:` list with `[label] path:start-end` (the title when there is no path) and the link on the next line, then a dim line `<model> · <latency> ms · <input> in / <output> out`. With `LORE_LLM=fake` the answer is `Fake answer from N sources.` followed by `[1] [2]` and so on: it exercises the plumbing without a model.

`GET /v1/info` needs no key. It reports what the server runs, for clients and health dashboards:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/info    # {"version":"0.1.0","llm":"fake","embedder":"hash","modes":["fast","deep"]}
```

`modes` lists `deep` only when the model provider can use tools (`anthropic` and `fake`, not `openai`).

## Web page

`GET /` serves a small built-in page for asking questions, for example in a standup. It is one self-contained HTML file embedded in the binary (no build step, no CDN) and needs no key to load. Open `LORE_URL/` (`http://localhost:8080/` with `make run`), paste a `read` key and type a question. Enter sends it, Shift+Enter adds a new line.

The key stays in the browser's local storage (under `lore.key`) and is sent only to this server, as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. If the browser blocks local storage, the page still works and you paste the key again on each visit. The answer shows with numbered citations that link to the sources; a source is a link only when its URL starts with `http://` or `https://`. The `deep` option is enabled only when `GET /v1/info` lists `deep` in `modes`.

The page logic is checked by `tests/web.rs`, which also runs `tests/web_pure.js` under node when node is installed.

## Use lore from agents

lore serves MCP (the Model Context Protocol) over streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, so an agent can search and ask questions about what you indexed. The endpoint is stateless and answers with plain JSON. It takes the same `lk_` tenant keys as the REST API, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, and the key needs the `read` scope. A missing or bad key is a 401 and a key without `read` is a 403, both with the usual `{"error": "..."}` body. Every tool sees only the key's own tenant.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http lore "$LORE_URL/mcp" --header "Authorization: Bearer $LORE_KEY"
```

Any other MCP client that speaks streamable HTTP works the same way: register `$LORE_URL/mcp` with the same `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.

| Tool | Input | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search` | `query`, `k` (1 to 50, default 8), `kind` (list of `code`, `doc`, `session`, `note`) | One text item: a JSON array of hits with `document_id`, `path`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `kind`, `title`, `source`, `score` and `snippet` (the first 40 lines) |
| `ask` | `question`, `mode` (`fast`, the default; `deep` runs the agent loop) | Two text items: the answer followed by a `Sources:` list with one line per citation, then the full `/v1/ask` response as JSON |
| `get_document` | `document_id` (the id of a search hit or a citation) | The document's text under a `# <title>` header with its kind and path, cut to 100,000 characters. An unknown id, or another tenant's, is the tool error `document not found` |
| `list_sources` | none | One text item: a JSON array of `{name, kind, indexed_commit, documents}` |

`scripts/mcp_smoke.sh` runs the whole exchange against a server: `LORE_URL=http://localhost:8080 LORE_ADMIN_TOKEN=dev-admin scripts/mcp_smoke.sh` prints the sorted tool names, the `src/billing/plans.rs` hit and `MCP SMOKE OK`. By default `/mcp` accepts any `Host` header; set `LORE_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to restrict it.
